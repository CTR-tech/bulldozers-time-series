    "# Prediction the sale price of \"bulldozers\" using ML [Kaggle Challenge]\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an old challenge on Kaggle for bulldozer price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "> Can we accurately predict the sale price of bulldozers based on their characteristics and previous sales?\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data URL: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data for this competition is split into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Train.csv` is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n",
    "* `Valid.csv` is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n",
    "* `Test.csv` is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "The evaluation metric for this competition is the `RMSLE` (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "Info about the features can be found on the Kaggle page > Data Dictionary"
